The Platelib by Hari Jayaram writes out dispense lists for the formulatrix robot.
The examples files hopefully describe how to use the library.
Example file list :
example1.py 
example2.py
example3.py

The examples are self explanatory. If you have any doubts please email the author harijay at the google mail gmail D O and T com 

TODO:
Graphical display of 96 well plate 
Fix tab de-limited file - Robot seems happy only after excel has munged the file
Graphical user interface : Suggestions on library to use are welcome. Top contender something that will work on linux, mac and windows i.e javascript with css and a webapp ( cgi form) . Alternatively something as boring as Tcl_tk or flashy like Flex or JavaFx script. Please write in with suggestions and if you are interested in helping.
